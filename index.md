## About Me

I'm a final-year Ph.D. student in [Language and Information Technology](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/) working in [Louis-Philippe Morency](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/)'s [MultiComp Lab](http://multicomp.cs.cmu.edu/).

**As a final-year CMU Ph.D. student, I'm excited to transition to an industry position with research-oriented projects. Please don't hesitate to reach out!**

## Interests

My expertise is application-inspired Machine Learning with the goal of socially aware AI technologies that benefit people by combining information from multiple modalities (through computer vision, speech processing, and natural language processing).

Examples of socially aware technologies that I helped create include:
1. developing behavior markers for symptoms of mental health;
2. automated estimation of social skills to improve public speaking; and
3. automated detection of sentiment, emotions, and mood.

-> For these AI applications, I focused on making them more transparent so that users can understand them better.
